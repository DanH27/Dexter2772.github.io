        <p>This week in class we held a workshop where each student picked a CSS property and showed the rest of the class how to use it correctly. I learned about a lot of different CSS properties and the one that I feel really surprised me was the animation property. This property was very neat because it got some elements on the page to move around very smoothly. On Monday and Tuesday we worked on the "creating a webpage from design" workshop. When we completed it I felt like I learned a lot on how to actually code the site in HTML and CSS. I'm hoping we will learn to create responsive websites soon becuase that is pretty much a necessity in todays environment where you have devices of different sizes browsing the web. And I hope we continue to learn more about correctly formating the structure of a webpage.</p>
